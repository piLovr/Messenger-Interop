This Project is a work in Progress (and not ready for use!). Feel free to contribute.

### Naming Convention
I put a lot of thought into how to name Objects like Groups, Channels, Guilds, Communities, since they represent similar structures, but are called different among different messengers/platforms.
If you have different thoughts about how to name things, feel free to tell me by opening an issue.
